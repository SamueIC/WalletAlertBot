# WalletAlertBot

This project was created for a crypto currency discord channel. Users can register crypto wallet addresses to their discord ID. When these wallets are mentioned in a channel, for example, when a raffle is conducted and the winners are announced, if the winning wallets are registered to a user then that user is direct messaged by the bot to tell them which server channel their wallet was mentioned and at what time.
